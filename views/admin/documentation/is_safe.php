<h3>How many security issues am i going to have using this module?</h3>
<p>userGroups has been developed in a paranoid state of mind.<br/>
The modules always does both client and server validation of every input field the user could change in any way, even using tools like firebug.</p>

<h3>So i'm not going to find any bug, right?</h3>
<p>Well, keep in mind that this module is a "one person work".<br/>
I tested it many and many times during development, and i'm pretty sure everything is working fine by now.<br/>
If you still find some bugs please report them leaving a comment on the module page on Yii website.</p>
